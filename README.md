# linked-list-thingy
I saw a picture of a doubly linked-list, and I wanted to write one.

The first pointer points forward to the second node, and backwards to the final one - the final node points forward to the first one (ie, the list is circular). I guess I could use a similar thing to create a circular queue or something like that, so that might be a thing I do one day...
